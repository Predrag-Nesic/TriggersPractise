# TriggersPractise

This is just a simple demonstration of the usage of triggers in MySQL
I have created a master table called "korisnici5", created a few triggers that respond on insert and update commands.
Than i have created a backup table in which a user is inserted after the insertion in the master table "korisnici5".

Hope you like it :)...
